# **TUTORIAL COMPLETED**

### *This is a new file created to signify I have completed the tutorial*

As a computer engineering major, I have used GitHub several times before for other classes so I am already familiar with how it works. I use VSCode as my IDE for editing my local repository and the GitHub desktop app for handling Git commands.

I'm curious to see how GitHub is helpful in a non-CS course as I have only used Git in my computer science classes.
